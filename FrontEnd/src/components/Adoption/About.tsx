      <div className="p-4 text-xl mb-4">
        Petfinder is an online, searchable database of animals who need homes.
        It is also a directory of nearly 11,000 animal shelters and adoption
        organizations across the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Organizations maintain
        their own home pages and available-pet databases.

        From the comfort of their personal computers, pet lovers can search for
        a pet that best matches their needs. They can then reference a shelterâ€™s
        web page and discover what services it offers. Petfinder also includes
        discussion forums, a pet-care resource directory and a library of free
        pet-care articles to help keep pets in their homes. Petfinder is updated
        DAILY. Organizations wishing to participate should register. A contact
        person should be responsible for direct communications with Petfinder.
        Only nonprofit organizations will be included (but Federal 501(c)(3)
        status is not necessary).
